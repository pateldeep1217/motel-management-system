Requirements and Context
I presented the following requirements to another AI, which generated the schema provided below. The schema and functionality should reflect the following real-world use case for a motel management system:

Workflow Overview
Guest Check-In:

A guest arrives and provides identification, such as a driver's license.
The ID is scanned, and the motel owner types in guest details:
Room number.
Price (daily rate or total).
Check-in date and time.
Check-out date.
A copy of the scanned ID is stored at the back of the physical record card, which is then filed into the room's slot.
Daily Accounting:

The motel owner manually logs all transactions (cash and card payments) in a notebook for the day.
The log is reset daily. For example:
If today's date is 11/26, the records for 11/26 are totaled.
On 11/27, a new table for 11/27 begins, with totals calculated separately for each day.
Example log format:
markdown
Copy code
Today's Date: 11/26
Room Number   Cash   Card
101            60
107                   60
------------------------------
              60 + 60 = 120
Guest Record Management:

The system must allow the motel owner to:
View a guest's complete booking history (past stays).
Mark a guest as "Do Not Rent" if they cause issues (e.g., damage, misconduct).
Each booking must include details such as check-in, check-out, and the status of the stay.
Room Management:

Allow the motel owner to:
Perform check-in and check-out operations for guests.
Mark a room as unavailable due to maintenance or issues.
Schema and API Critique
Please critically review the schema generated by the other AI (provided below) based on the above requirements. Focus on:

Data Model:

Are the relationships and data types aligned with the business needs?
Is the schema normalized appropriately, and does it avoid redundancy?
Are the fields and constraints sufficient to support the daily logging and guest record functionality?
Does the schema handle scenarios such as marking guests or rooms as restricted or unavailable?
API Design:

Suggest a list of API endpoints required to implement the functionality.
Ensure the API supports the following key features:
Check-in and check-out for guests.
Retrieving daily totals of payments (cash/card) for accounting.
Viewing the booking history for a specific guest.
Marking rooms or guests with special statuses (e.g., “Do Not Rent”).
Suggest improvements for API flexibility, maintainability, and security.
General Improvements:

Refactor the schema or API suggestions to better suit the use case if necessary.
Ensure the design supports scalability and avoids potential pitfalls.
